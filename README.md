# Nyaruko Telegram Bot

[English](README.md) | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README.cn.md)

Welcome to the exotic Nyaruko Telegram Bot project! üåü This one-of-a-kind Telegram bot is deployed on the high-performance Cloudflare Workers. Nyaruko is not just any bot, but a sprite companion for Niracler, always ready to execute whimsical and unique tasks. Inspired by the leading character Nyaruko from "Haiyore! Nyaruko-san" and rooted in the Lovecraftian Mythos, our bot brings surprises and quirky fun at every corner! üëæ

## Feature Introduction

Currently, Nyaruko has the following stunning features:

### `/sync_twitter` - Synchronize Telegram messages to Twitter

With the `/sync_twitter` command, Nyaruko can synchronize messages from Telegram to Twitter. Let your thoughts take flight and soar into another social media realm. üïäÔ∏è However, Nyaruko is still growing and currently does not support hyperlinks or handle Telegram's `media_group`. Cleverly caching history in Cloudflare is needed, and it is believed that Nyaruko will soon learn this new skill! üéì

### About Setting Environment Variables

To set up environment variables, please use the `wrangler` CLI tool of Cloudflare Workers as follows:

wrangler secret put TWITTER_API_KEY
# Repeat the above steps to set all required variables
...
```

For a more detailed explanation of wrangler configuration and commands, refer to the [official wrangler documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/) (The wrangler documents are much easier to understand compared to the Twitter documentation, mainly because there are a lot more examples~~).

### Little Secret of Nyaruko

The name Nyaruko originates from the Japanese light novel series ‚ÄúHaiyore! Nyaruko-san,‚Äù where the heroine Nyaruko is an energetic and positive Cthulhu mythical creature modeled after Nyarlathotep from Lovecraftian Mythos. In the Nyaruko bot, it represents a symbol of intelligence and vitality, not only assisting Niracler in message handling but also adding a touch of two-dimensional fun to life! üåà
