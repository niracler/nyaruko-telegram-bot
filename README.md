## How to Run Nyaruko

To get Nyaruko up and running in your environment, please follow these steps:

1. Prepare your Cloudflare Workers environment.
2. Configure the necessary environment variables using the `wrangler secret` command to set them.
3. Deploy the Nyaruko bot to Cloudflare Workers.

### Clone and Enter the Project Directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niracler/nyaruko-telegram-bot && cd nyaruko-telegram-bot
```

### Environment Variables

Nyaruko requires the following environment variables to function:

|Variable Name|Required|Configuration Method|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`ALLOWED_USER_IDS`|Yes|`wrangler.yml`|List of user IDs allowed to use the bot, separated by commas|
|`TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME`|No|`wrangler.yml`|Your Telegram bot username, used to enable AI chat|
|`TELEGRAM_BOT_SECRET`|Yes|`secret`|Your Telegram bot secret key ([details](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot))|
|`XLOG_TOKEN`|No|`secret`|xLog token. Used to enable xlog synchronization|
|`XLOG_CHARACTER_ID`|No|`secret`|xLog characterId|
|`TWITTER_API_KEY`|No|`secret`|Your Twitter API key ([details](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)), used to enable Twitter synchronization|
|`TWITTER_API_SECRET`|No|`secret`|Your Twitter API secret key|

### About Setting Environment Variables

To set up environment variables, please use the `wrangler` CLI tool of Cloudflare Workers as follows:

```bash
wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_SECRET
# Enter the corresponding value when prompted

wrangler secret put TWITTER_API_KEY
# Repeat the above steps to set all required variables
...
```

For a more detailed explanation of wrangler configuration and commands, refer to the [official wrangler documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/) (The wrangler documents are much easier to understand compared to the Twitter documentation, mainly because there are a lot more examples~~).

### Create D1 Database

Because Nyaruko uses D1 as its database, you need to create a D1 database and configure the corresponding environment variables. The configuration method is as follows:

```bash
wrangler d1 create tg
```

Then fill in the name of the D1 database returned into `wrangler.toml`, and change the database_id in my configuration file to your D1 database id.

> Note⚠️: Before Nyaruko is deployed, messages with multiple images will not be synchronized to xLog because the corresponding media_group_id cannot be found in the D1 database. Later, we will consider creating a script to synchronize historical messages.

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB" # i.e. available in your Worker on env.DB
database_name = "tg"
database_id = "******"
```

create database table
  
```bash
wrangler d1 execute tg --file=./schema.sql
```

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

After completing the above steps, you can deploy Nyaruko to Cloudflare Workers.

```bash
$ wrangler deploy
  ...

Uploaded nyaruko-telegram-bot (3.10 sec)
Published nyaruko-telegram-bot (0.44 sec)
  https://your-worker.your-name.workers.dev/"

  ...
```

### Set Webhook for Telegram Bot

After deploying Nyaruko to Cloudflare Workers, you need to set the webhook for the Telegram bot. The configuration method is as follows:

```bash
curl -F "url=https://your-worker.your-name.workers.dev/" https://api.telegram.org/bot<TELEGRAM_BOT_SECRET>/setWebhook
```

Now, Nyaruko is ready to use! 🎉

sync_twitter - Sync msg to Twitter.
sync_xlog - Sync msg to XLog.
ping - Test if the bot is online.
getchatid - Get the ID of the current chat.

## Little Secret of Nyaruko

The name Nyaruko originates from the Japanese light novel series “Haiyore! Nyaruko-san,” where the heroine Nyaruko is an energetic and positive Cthulhu mythical creature modeled after Nyarlathotep from Lovecraftian Mythos. In the Nyaruko bot, it represents a symbol of intelligence and vitality, not only assisting Niracler in message handling but also adding a touch of two-dimensional fun to life! 🌈
